## Welcome to the CISAT Paper Collective

__What is CISAT?__ The Center for Information Systems & Technology at CGU.

**What is meant by papers?** Research articles related to the development, orperation, or application of technology. This includes research in areas of Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Information Systems, as well as any field beyond those mentioned that deals with the application of technology (e.g. bioengineering, the psychology of computer use, application of technology in the arts, etc.). This means that transdisciplinary papers are welcomed, and there is no limit to the fields that can be discussed as long as they intersect with technology in some form.

**What is meant by Collective?** This is a community, with all members sharing ownership. In other words, this is your space! Just as you would seek to keep your own space clean, let's work together to preserve this space as a positive and uplifting one where curious individuals discuss papers and engage in collaborations in a respectful manner and without concerns for "knowing enough" or "not being qualified". No matter your background or experience you are welcome to come learn with us!
