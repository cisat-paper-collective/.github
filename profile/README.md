## Welcome to the CISAT Paper Collective

What is CISAT? The Center for Information Systems & Technology at CGU.

What is meant by papers? Research articles related to technology. This includes research on applications of technology outside of Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Information Systems. Transdisciplinary papers are welcomed, and there is no limit to the fields that can be discussed as long as they involve some application of technology.

What is meant by Collective? This is a community, with all members sharing ownership. In other words, this is your space! Just as you would seek to keep your own space clean, let's work together to preserve this space as a positive and uplifting one where curious individuals discuss papers and engage in collaborations in a respectful manner and without concerns for "knowing enough" or "not being qualified". No matter your background or experience you are welcome.
